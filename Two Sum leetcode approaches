first we need some variables we call them ,
arraypocket = {} ,remains .

1) the main logic behind this problem is we derive remains = target - nums[i] 
to identify if we have any previous number in our pocket that we have 
so that we doesn't need to derive it from the target value , we
check it by remains in pocket :
return [pocket[remains] , i]
if not it means the value is not in our dictionary 
so we need to store it in our dictonary .

our main logic is done , now we are about to return our pocket value as output.
