we approaches this problem by the core logic of the problem 
and is : buy = 0 < prices[i] . if profit = prices[i] - buy and after we update the today's buy on the basis of 
today's prices[i] .
the main thing of there is that we can't cross  our limit of buying without selling or i mean earning 
any money . when ever we can earn we can then think how much money i can afford and earn by selling the product
that make it possible to have much money on my pocket. 
todayBuy <= TodaySell 
todayProfit = TodaySell - Todaybuy
then we get the required things.
It's actually like saving account approaches.
